## We create free open source software for people. 
We are a team of FOSS developers committed to building open-source solutions that reflect the human value. We develop and contribute to free open source alternatives to subscription based applications. Our goal is to give the best software experience possible to the public with minimal downsides.

#### CnCC
Chainet Code Collective is a non-profit developer community based on the web internationally. As of 2025 we have contributed to many open source projects, repositories and initiatives. We are glad and proud that we never lost our human structure. We still believe in an open internet and will continue to work for better infrastructure.

CnCC is a community driven, mostly web focused software development team. The community contributes, maintains and sponsors open source projects. The mission is to protect the free web, keep software free and accessible to everyone. Key factors that differentiate us from other organizations are that we make FOSS software that puts high importance on accessibility, privacy and self hostability of software. As of 2025, CnCC is not based in any country and is fully driven by a worldwide collective of developers.
